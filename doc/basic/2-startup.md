# startup

congratulations on installing input-modifier. here you will learn how to use it.

## start the daemon

after you've installed input-modifier, run the following:

```
imodd
```

this will start the input-modifier daemon. if it fails, make sure you have installed it correctly. if that is the case, you may want to report an issue and I'll be glad to fix it as soon as you do.

if you see the following:

```
[info] done! running.
```

then it means you've done everything correctly. let's move on to [devices](3-devices.md).

## but wait. what about autostart?

that's something marked as to-do. but it will eventually happen.

for now, you'll have to start the input-modifier daemon manually.
